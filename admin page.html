<p> we couldn't have this going into the
 hands of other people especially not the police.</p>
 <p>this is the best explanation we can give you and our last goodbye.
 we feel like you deserve it.</p>
 <p> this site was originally made for the nature blog, felix and jake never got to release it, though</p>
 <p> we are writing this in a hurry.</p>
 <p> we don't know what that thing following us for the past months is 
 but we know it won't stop until we're gone.</p>
 <p>we will be on the move. either we'll escape it or die trying. here are our last words to you:</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <span>hi this is felix.</span> <br>
 <span> i want to start by saying that i'm sorry. it was all my fault.</span><br>
<span> i killed him. it made me do it and i deserve to die sowly and painfully for it i know this</span><br>
<span> i loved jake more than anything and i'll never forgive myself. i drugged him on purpose and lied </span><br>
<span>to freyja and to you guys. now you know the truth. freyja has decided to forgive me i don't know why.</span><br>
<span> she says we don't have much time so i'm just leaving this as a confession.</span><br>
<span>time is luck, and i wish ours overlapped more or for longer, jake. i am in love with you. see you in another life, my love.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span> freyja here.</span>
<br>
<span> i will try my best to keep both me and felix alive.</span><br>
<span> i know it wasn't his fault. that thing messes with your brain.</span><br>
<span>i'm sorry that it had to come to this and i'm sorry that we don't have any clear answers for you.</span><br>
<span> stay strong, we love you forever.</span><br>
<br>
<span> everything will be okay.</span>
